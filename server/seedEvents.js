Put on your wireless headphones and choose your channel – three DJs go head to head, and YOU decide who wins by switching between them. It's interactive, it's hilarious, and it's incredibly fun!

🎧 HOW IT WORKS:
Each attendee receives premium wireless headphones with three channels. Each channel plays a different genre:
• Channel RED - Pop & Commercial Hits
• Channel GREEN - Hip Hop & R&B
• Channel BLUE - Electronic & House

The headphones glow in the color of your chosen channel, creating a visual spectacle of color as people dance to their preferred music. The DJ with the most listeners wins!

✨ WHAT MAKES IT SPECIAL:
• Perfect for late-night parties (no noise complaints!)
• See people dancing to different beats next to each other
• Ultra-high-quality sound directly in your ears
• Complete control over your music and volume
• Hilarious when you take off the headphones

🎉 THE EXPERIENCE:
The rooftop transforms into a party where two people next to each other might be dancing to completely different songs. Sing along to your track while your friend can't hear a thing – it's comedy gold!

Warning: Side effects may include uncontrollable dancing and laughing at your friends singing songs you can't hear!`,
